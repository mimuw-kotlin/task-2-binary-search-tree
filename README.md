# Task 2: Binary Search Tree

## Specification

Your task is to implement a simple generic binary search tree (BST).
It doesn't have to be self-balancing. See the interfaces in file `app/src/main/kotlin/BinarySearchTree.kt`.
BST is split into two interfaces: `BinarySearchTree` and `MutbaleBinarySearchTree` - 
just like the standard library collections.

## Implementation
(Same as in Task 1)

This project uses the Gradle build system.
Code can be autoformatted by running `./gradlew ktlintFormat`.
In case you hate the default formatting rules, you can change them in `app/build.gradle.kts`, see line 14.

You should not use any external libraries.

## Grading

You can get up to 2 points from this task.

One point is given for successfully running `./gradlew check`. 
It runs the tests (publicly available in the file `app/src/test/kotlin/Tests.kt`) and auto-checks the code style.
The other point is given for the quality of the code, reviewed manually.
